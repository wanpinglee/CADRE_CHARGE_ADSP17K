**Note:** This repository collects scripts for CADRE and CHARGE joint project that aims to conduct association analyses of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) by using ADSP 17K whole genome sequence (WGS) data which is NIAGADS R3 release.

## Project Files Description
### Input file
- Bi-allelic **QC** VCFs (one VCF for a autosomal) with 16,905 samples released in October 2021
- Multi-allelic VCFs (one VCF for a autosomal) with 16,906 samples released in March 2021
- Phenotype file

### Output file
- VCFs (one VCF for a autosomal) with sample and variant filtering done
- Summary csv files of association analyses

---

## Steps
1. VCF preparation [README](scripts/vcf_preparation/README.md)
2. Single-variant association analysis for variant with MAF > 0.5% [README](scripts/single_variant_assoc/README.md)
3. Gene-based testing for coding variant with MAF < 1% using STAAR [README](scripts/staar/README.md)
4. Rare noncoding variants


## Dependencies
### Tools
- HTS library v1.12 (has embedded in [libs](libs))
- bcftools v1.12 (has embedded in [libs](libs))
